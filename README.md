# BiedriApp
The "Biedri" app was made as part of the DigiEduHack hackathon. It was crafted using FlutterFlow visual development platform. FlutterFlow uses the Flutter framework ond the code is written in Dart programming language.

The app is fully functioning, however it isn't deployed to the Play store or the App store. "Biedri" app works on Android, IOS and Web. It is designed for smartphone size devices. The project includes original design elements (logo, loading screen, brand name).
