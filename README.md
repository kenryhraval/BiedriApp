# BiedriApp
The "Biedri" app was made as part of the DigiEduHack hackathon. It was crafted using FlutterFlow visual development platform. FlutterFlow uses the Flutter framework ond the code is written in Dart programming language. The database is stored on Cloud Firestore (NoSQL online document database).

The app is fully functioning, however it hasn't been deployed to the Play store or the App store. "Biedri" app works on Android, IOS and Web. It is designed for smartphone size devices. The project includes original design elements (logo, loading screen, brand name).

1) Link to the FlutterFlow project. You can run the app from your computer after signing in (for running the application an a emulator (run mode), select v12 version):
https://app.flutterflow.io/project/biedri-lbd3k4

2) Web app domain (will work on any device, but should be executed from a smartphone for decent view):
https://biedri-lbd3k4.flutterflow.app/
